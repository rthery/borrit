## [0.1.0-preview.1] - 2020-01-11

### This is the first release of Borrit.

Borrit is a tool for Unity adding a soft lock system in the Editor Project window
allow you and your team to mark assets as borrowed.

This version is a PoC, at the moment it only supports Google Sheets as a pseudo database to store the state of
borrowed assets, although it has been built to have more databases supported in the future.
